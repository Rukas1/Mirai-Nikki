                <h2>Short Introduction</h2>
                <p class="textBox">
                    <strong>Yuno Gasai</strong> (我妻 由乃, Gasai Yuno) is the main female protagonist of the Future Diary series. 
                    She is the Second in the Survival Game and she is the owner of the "Yukiteru Diary/ Diary of future love". 
                    She is obsessed with Yukiteru Amano, the main male protagonist of the story. He is her love interest.

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p class="textBox">
                    Yuno Gasai is a young teenage girl with pink eyes and long pink hair styled in pigtails, two strands of hair 
                    hanging as frontal locks featuring a pair of red bows, and the back pigtails left bare. Her most common attire 
                    consists of a blue shirt with a ribbon on her chest accompanied by a blue skirt with high socks (school uniform), 
                    but her wardrobe changes occasionally throughout the series.

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p class="textBox">
                    Yuno's personality is ambiguous. For the most part she is sweet, feminine, and sometimes shy when around Yukiteru. 
                    But, this masks her dark and sanguinary side—ruthless, cold and calculating. She has little, if any, problem with 
                    using and taking advantage of others for her goals: her and Yukiteru's survival. She will resort to cruel and usually 
                    violent methods, most of the time coming out of nowhere, that generally end in bloody deaths, of either a Diary Holder 
                    or their followers, effectively making her a Yandere.This was the beginning of her changes, as she later became quite 
                    lonely and sorrowful...
